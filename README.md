# Plant_Diesease_Detection

## Introduction
The agricultural industry, comprising more than 570 million farms globally, has historically relied on manual inspections. As an illustration, a study conducted in 2010, required a team of five specialists two weeks to inspect a 50-acre farm. 
In India, where approximately 60% of its 1.3 billion inhabitants are engaged in agriculture, manual inspections can be time-consuming, leading to delays in essential crop management tasks. 
Recent advancements in machine learning and image recognition have significantly enhanced accuracy rates. For example, a study conducted in 2020 demonstrated a 95% accuracy rate in the identification of grape leaf diseases through the use of AI.

## Dataset
In this dataset, around 87,000 RGB images are included, offering a diverse range of healthy and diseased crop leaves. The dataset encompasses 38 different classes representing various plant species and diseases!
